# pilotfish

I needed to figure out how to attach a child window to the side of
a PySimpleGUI-based program's main window.  In the process of working
that out, I got side-tracked by this little time-waster.

Move the window with the shark, the window with the pilotfish follows
(or leads -- depending on which of three relatively positions is
randomly selected at run time.)

I dunno, maybe it's cute?
