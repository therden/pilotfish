# pilotfish

I needed to figure out how to attach a child window to the side of
a PySimpleGUI-based program's main window.  In the process of working
that out, I got side-tracked by this little time-waster.

Grab and move the shark, and the pilotfish follows (or leads --
depending on which of three possible relative positions is randomly
selected at run time.)  

Right-click on the shark and choose **Exit** to close the program.
